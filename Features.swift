    // * For heavy sleepers, the combination of an alarm at 100% volume + vibration makes it much more likely to wake up during nighttime.
    // * For this feature to work as intended, Loops info.plist much be amended with "audio" permissions,
    //      see Loop->Signing & Capabilities->Background Modes->"Audio, AirPlay, Picture in picture" in xcode
